## 🧠 How to Play  
1. Press the **Start** button to begin the game.  
2. Watch the sequence carefully — each color represents a tone.  
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the same colored buttons in order.  
4. The sequence grows longer each round — try to keep up!  
5. If you press the wrong color, the game ends. 😅
